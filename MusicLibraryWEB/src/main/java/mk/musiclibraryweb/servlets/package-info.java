/**
 * This package contains servlets for handling music library web requests. 
 * These servlets interact with the front-end of the web application to perform actions such as 
 * adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting songs, as well as managing user settings like theme preferences.
 * 
 * The servlets handle HTTP requests, process the data (e.g., songs information), 
 * and send appropriate responses to the client-side (e.g., HTML, JSON).
